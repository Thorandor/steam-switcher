# steam-switcher
A simple bat file to switch between different steam profiles


Usage:
1. Download the bat file and edit the required names for your accounts in Notepad or any other text editing application. Note, the order goes in reverse, so account 2 will need to be entered first in line 24
2. Save and place the bat file anywhere (I keep it in my Steam folder)
3. Run it whenever you need to switch (note, you will have had to have started both accounts at least once on your machine)
