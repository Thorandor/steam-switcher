# steam-switcher
A simple bat file to switch between different steam profiles


Usage:
1. Download the repo and edit the required names for your accounts. Note, the order goes in reverse, so account 2 will need to be entered first in line 24
2. Rename the SteamSwitch.txt SteamSwitch.bat (or any other name for the bat file)
3. Place it anywhere
4. Run it whenever you need to switch (note, you will have had to have started both accounts at least once on your machine)
